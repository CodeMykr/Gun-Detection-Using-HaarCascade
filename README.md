# Gun-Detection-Using-HaarCascade
There is some custom cascade files to detect weapon ( pistol ) using Haar-Cascade Algorithm with OpenCv.

The "cascade f2.xml" in the CustomCascade file, has the best results we achieved in this object-detection system but it does not work as efficiently as the OpenCV Haar-Cascade Face Detection algorithm.
