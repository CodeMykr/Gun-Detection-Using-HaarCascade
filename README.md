# Gun-Detection-Using-HaarCascade
There is some custom cascade files to detect weapon ( pistol ) using Haar-Cascade Algorithm with OpenCv.

We used at least 2000 Positive and 900 Negative object pictures for training and changing the parameters we get 12 different cascade.xml file aiming to detect a pistol.
The "cascade f2.xml" in the CustomCascades file, has the best results we achieved in this object-detection system but it does not work as efficiently as the OpenCV Haar-Cascade Face Detection algorithm.
